Intro to *markdown*

Md -> lots of things

Originally to html, also to pdf/word/slides/others

Rmd just mixing md with R code. Two step process Run R code, turn into md output and insert in place. Then run md conversion

What does it let us do?
Demo of analysis

Demo of lessons?

Demo from Loretta?

(Ex.) Why? - Why might you want to mix. Could just write well commented code? Write ideas in slack.
*Directly* integrate outputs with code. Never have to worry about versions. 

(Disc.) Context and communication:
Still need to think about audience. Show/hide (some?) code, level of polish of figures

How does it work?
