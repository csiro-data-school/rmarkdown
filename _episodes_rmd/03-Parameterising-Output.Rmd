Parameterising with Rmarkdown
	Hide all code blocks for external clients by parameterising echo in your global options
	
	(Ex.) Change country for plot with parameters
	

Rmd docs to drive reproducibility
	- Don't hard code directories - relative paths and self contained projects
	
	- Run clean (does it work if you restart RStudio and knit immediately?)

	- Track with git -> link code changes with output changes
