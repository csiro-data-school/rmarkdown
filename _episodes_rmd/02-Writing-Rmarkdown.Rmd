```{r chunk_options, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("02-")
```

How does it work?

(Ex.) New Rmd in RStudio, delete everything after YAML -> YAML is some *metadata* and options about how to process

Show some options for YAML data? 
(Ex.) Add author, date

Knit it, talk about output. Rmd vs Preview, vs html file

Intro to md markup format
	# Headers
	## Headers
	*ital*
	**bold**

	[link](http://)
	!["Pretty figure"](fig/img.png)

	 - lista
	 - listb

	1) step1
	2) step2

	Footnotes [^X]
	[^X]: explanation
	
	`verbatim code` (like slack)
	
(Ex.) Write some notes on course so far "Notes.Rmd". Headers, 'paras', lists, link to lessons? Knit it again

Integrating R code
	Code chunks - demo - Two step process, knitr runs code, formats as md. Then
	Read data, manipulate and print df, basic plot

	Break out into different sections, setup, manip, plot

	First one manually, second by highlighting and using insert again

	Chunk options. Which of "Run code, show code, show output" do we want for each block. Tick all that apply

	show table of options with all that apply (eval, echo, results) all default to TRUE
	
	(Ex.) Which options need to change for the three blocks? Demo first, do rest alone

	Move chunks to appropriate part of file, reknit.

	(Ex.) fig.width/height options, size in inches. DIY some changes

	Set global options in settings chunk `knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=6, fig.height=6)`

	*Inline code*
	Describe why filtering down to one country by explaining `r nrow(gapminder)/12` countries is too many.
